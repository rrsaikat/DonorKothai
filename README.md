-->

## Working Procedure
This app keeps a list of voluntary donors.

A Voluntary Donor has to make an account on our app with some general information like:

    Name
    Age
    Blood Group
    Birth Date
    Purpose of Blood Request
    Current Location [Can also provide access to his live location].
On the other side, the one who needs blood, will create a request for blood unit with his blood group and location.

    Red pins ----> Donors
    Green pins --> Recievers
                    
On Creating a Blood Request
All persons near him i.e. our voluntary donors will receive notification for such request. (e.g. Person A needs blood at XYZ hospital or 123.456.789 location)

OR

The requester is shown a map of all the blood donors with the requested blood group with their live location near him. (Consider an example when we search for vehicles on PATHAO or UBER app)

## Benefits and Objectives
 1. Connecting Blood Donors and Recipients.
 2. Sometimes people don't find blood at the correct time. This app can help by connecting donors and recipients.
 3. Reduce the wastage of blood.
 4. Usually Blood banks store more blood so that they fulfil every requirement because the demand for blood is undefined.

## Features
 1. Secured authentication by phone.
 2. Geo-Query on google map w.r.t specific blood groups.
 2. One tap calling.
 3. Give direction to the targeted user.
 4. Can make request for blood along with donors.

## Upcoming Features
 1. Cancel option for blood request.
 2. Show person's image into the marker.
 3. User ratings option.
