## Working Procedure
This app keeps a list of voluntary donors.

A Voluntary Donor has to make an account on our app with some general information like:

Name
Age
Blood Group
Current Location [Can also provide access to his live location].
On the other side, the one who needs blood, will create a request for blood unit with his blood group and location.

On Creating a Blood Request
All persons near him i.e. our voluntary donors will receive notification for such request. (e.g. Person A needs blood at XYZ hospital or 123.456.789 location)

OR

The requester is shown a map of all the blood donors with the requested blood group with their live location near him. (Consider an example when we search for cab on Ola or Uber app)

## Benefits and Objectives
Connecting Blood Donors and Recipients.
Sometimes people don't find blood at the correct time. This app can help there by connecting donors and recipients.
Reduce the wastage of blood.
Usually Blood banks store more blood so that they fulfil every requirement because the demand for blood is undefined.

## User Manual
Use the project with your own Firebase instance and Google Maps API key
